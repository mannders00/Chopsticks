To anyone interested in understanding this program

To turn an input into an expected output, I need to translate some output into a move in the game. Since there are not too many moves, I will map every possible move to an integer. Here is the reference.

0 = Attack left with left
1 = Attack right with left
2 = Attack left with right
3 = Attack right with right

4 = Split 1 from left to right
5 = Split 2 from left to right
6 = Split 3 from left to right
7 = Split 4 from left to right

8 = Split 1 from right to left
9 = Split 2 from right to left
10 = Split 3 from right to left
11 = Split 4 from right to left
